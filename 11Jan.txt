3. zsh : It's possible to run Zsh on Windows, but only on top of a Linux or Linux-like layer such as Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Cygwin. That installation is out of scope so for now i have skipped it but i do have gone through the documentations.
My understanding: zsh is a upgraded version of cmd which can do the word of a cmd terminal but can do more. Like it can search using `ls **/tofind.txt`, zsh tab completion: it works as an intelligent ide which can auto complete a path or directory based on the initials after tab is clicked and Wildcards.
