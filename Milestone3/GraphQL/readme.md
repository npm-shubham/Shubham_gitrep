Please note that the Graphql collection is not shareable as it is still in beta stage in Postman
But if you just open postman, make a new collection which supports Graphql, make a new qraphql request and enter this
![http://localhost:4000/graphql/users](image.png) or
![http://localhost:4000/graphql/review](image-1.png) or
![http://localhost:4000/graphql/bookings](image-2.png)

it will automatically generate the queries and mutations. And just clicks will do the work. 
This is a how it would look like ![Bookings query automatically generated](image-3.png)
